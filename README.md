# LSTM-DTW
This repo provides a framework for building LSTM and Dynamic Time Warping models for multi-variate time-series data. The primary intention is to have a backup for the main framework used in zebrafish VMR analyis, but can be generalized to any mutli-variate time-series data. 

The LSTM can be built from TensorFlow/Keras or Pytorch. 

The input data uses normalized VMR data from Leung Lab, Purdue University.

If you are intereted in learning more about the models and input data, please contact me.
